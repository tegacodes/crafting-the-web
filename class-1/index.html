        Ah, the freshness in the face of leaving a task undone! To be remiss is
        to be positively out in the country! What a refuge it is to be
        completely unreliable! I can breathe easier now that the appointments
        are behind me. I missed them all, through deliberate negligence, Having
        waited for the urge to go, which I knew wouldn’t come. I’m free, and
        against organized, clothed society. I’m naked and plunge into the water
        of my imagination. It’s too late to be at either of the two meetings
        where I should have been at the same time, Deliberately at the same
        time... No matter, I’ll stay here dreaming verses and smiling in
        italics. This spectator aspect of life is so amusing! I can’t even light
        the next cigarette... If it’s an action,
        <br />
        It can wait for me, along with the others, in the non-meeting called
        life.
